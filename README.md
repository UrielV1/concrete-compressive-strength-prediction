## Project objective
Predicting concrete compressive strength given its components

## Project description
- A dataset of 11,330 records and 18 features is given
- Main features: finishedsqft, bathrooms, zindexvalue         
- Data exploration & Data visualization were executed
- The 71 neighborhoods were clustered using it's frequency and mean price
- Linear regression, Random forest, KNN and Gradient boosting models were used
- Columns were iterated in order to find the best combination
- The best score was 0.70 using Random forest model
